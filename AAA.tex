		\section{1. Introduction}
		\subsection{1.1 Purpose}
		\hspace{1cm}ICT labs play a vital role in providing students and researchers with the tools they need to succeed in their studies and research. However, managing these labs effectively can be a challenge. Manually managing lab resources, such as hardware, software, and consumables, can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, scheduling lab time and resources can be difficult, and it can be challenging to track lab usage accurately.
		\subsection{1.2 Proposed Solution}
		\hspace{1cm}To address these challenges, we propose the development of a web-based ICT lab management system (ICT LMS). The ICT LMS provides a comprehensive solution for managing ICT lab resources, including hardware, software, and consumables. It also facilitates lab scheduling and booking, maintains accurate records of lab usage, and generates reports on ICT lab usage.
		\subsection{1.3 System Overview}
		\hspace{1cm}an ICT lab management system (ICT LMS) is a software application that helps educational institutions manage their ICT labs effectively. It provides a centralized platform for managing ICT lab resources, scheduling lab time, tracking usage, and generating reports. ICT LMS can provide several benefits to educational institutions, including improved resource utilization, enhanced user experience, reduced operational costs, data-driven decision-making, and enhanced security.

		\section{2. Literature Review}
		\hspace{1cm}ICT lab management systems (ICT LMS) play an important role in improving resource utilization, managing scheduling, tracking usage, and generating reports. They provide a centralized platform that streamlines ICT lab operations. ICT LMS has been shown to enhance user experience for both instructors and students by simplifying lab access, resource booking, and communication. Instructors can schedule lab time for their classes, assign students to lab workstations, monitor student activity in the lab, and submit feedback on lab resources. Students can book lab time, use lab resources to complete coursework, request assistance from lab technicians, and submit feedback on lab resources.
		
		\hspace{1cm}ICT Lab Management System also promotes data-driven decision-making in ICT lab management by providing detailed usage reports and analytics, which enable administrators to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and evaluate the performance of their labs. This data-driven approach has been shown to improve lab utilization rates, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance overall lab effectiveness. While ICT Lab Management System offers significant benefits, it also presents challenges, such as initial investment in hardware, software, and training required to set up and maintain the system.
		
		\hspace{1cm}To overcome these challenges, institutions should provide comprehensive training and support for users, as well as incentives for using the system effectively. Implementing ICT LMS can improve resource utilization, enhance user experience, reduce operational costs, and promote data-driven decision-making. Institutions should carefully consider their needs and resources before implementing an ICT LMS and should provide comprehensive training and support to ensure user acceptance and effective utilization of the system.

		\section{7. Testing And Evaluation}
		\subsection{7.1 White Box Testing}
		White-box test used to test the inner part of the "box", and it focuses on utilizing inside learning of the product to direct the choice of test information. This tests include: structural test, glass-box and clear-box. White box testing is expensive than black box. It takes the source code, before the tests can be. This is significantly more like in the assurance of exact information and the assurance if the product is or is not right. This testing is connected just with the product item; it can't guarantees that the entire specification has been executed. The clear box or WhiteBox name symbolizes the ability to see through the software's outer shell (or "box") into its inner workings. Likewise, the "black box" in "Black Box Testing symbolizes not being able to see the inner workings of the software so that only the end-user experience can be tested

		\subsection{7.2 Black Box Testing}
		Black box testing is a technique of software testing which examines the functionality of software without peering. into its internal structure or coding. The primary source of black box testing is a specification of requirements that is stated by the customer.
		In this method, tester selects a function and gives input value to examine its functionality, and checks whether the function is giving expected output or not. If the function produces correct output, then it is passed in testing, otherwise failed. The test team reports the result to the development team and then tests the next function. After completing testing of all functions if there are severe problems, then it is given back to the development team for

			- Test the system's handling of application requests by lab lab incharge, ensuring they can efficiently review, approve, or decline requests.\\
			- Verify that notifications or status updates are correctly displayed to lab lab incharge after approval or rejection.\\
			
			\textbf{6. Boundary Value Testing:}\\
			- Submit data near the boundary values for different fields, such as the maximum and minimum lengths for staff details or the maximum duration for leave requests.\\
			- Ensure the system handles these boundary values appropriately.\\
			
			\textbf{7. Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility Testing:}\\
			- Test the application on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, smartphones) to ensure consistent functionality and appearance.\\
			
			\textbf{8. Concurrency Testing:}\\
			- Simulate scenarios where multiple users access the system simultaneously to assess how it handles concurrent interactions without data corruption or conflicts.\\
			
			\textbf{9. Error Handling and Messages:}\\
			- Validate error messages and system notifications, ensuring they are clear, concise, and provide guidance on resolving issues.\\
			
			\textbf{10. Security Testing:}\\
			- Assess the security of user data during interactions with the system.\\
			- Test for unauthorized access attempts and ensure proper encryption of sensitive information.\\
			
			\textbf{11. Performance Testing:}\\
			- Evaluate the system's response time and performance under normal and peak loads, ensuring it meets acceptable performance standards.\\
			
			Black box testing, when systematically conducted with these scenarios, helps ensure that the staff details management and leave application system performs as expected from an end-user perspective and meets the specified requirements.

		\subsection{7.3 Test Case Generation}
		Testing aims at finding errors in a system or program. A set of tests is also called a test suite. Test case generation is the process of generating test suites for a particular system. Model-based Testing (MBT) is a technique to generate test suites for a system from a model describing the system. One usually tries to generate test suite which satisfies a given coverage criterion.

			\textbf{1. Positive Test Cases} \\
			
			Positive testing is the type of testing that can be performed on the system by providing the valid data as input. It checks whether system behaves as expected with positive inputs. This test is done to check the system that does what it is supposed to do.
			
			\textbf{2. Negative Test Cases}\\
			
			Negative Testing is a variant of testing that can be performed on the system by providing invalid data as input. It checks whether an system behaves as expected with the negative inputs. This is to test the system does not do anything that it is not supposed to do so.
